# V5-Beta Migration Summary

This document summarizes the migration of the `ai-sdk-provider-claude-code` to be compatible with the Vercel AI SDK v5-beta.

## Current Status

The migration is complete. The codebase is now compatible with the Vercel AI SDK v5-beta. All tests are passing, TypeScript compilation is successful, and the examples have been updated to use the new APIs.

## Modified Files

The following files were modified during the migration:

*   `package.json`: Updated to use the `@beta` versions of the `ai`, `@ai-sdk/provider`, and `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` packages.
*   `src/claude-code-language-model.ts`: Updated to implement the `LanguageModelV2` interface, and the `doGenerate` and `doStream` methods were updated to handle the new message format.
*   `src/convert-to-claude-code-messages.ts`: Updated to handle the new `ModelMessage` format and added v4 compatibility.
*   `src/map-claude-code-finish-reason.ts`: Updated to use the `LanguageModelV2FinishReason` type.
*   `src/claude-code-provider.ts`: Updated to use the `ProviderV2` and `LanguageModelV2` types.
*   `examples/basic-usage.ts`: Updated to use the new `streamText` API with proper async handling.
*   `examples/conversation-history.ts`: Updated to use the new `streamText` API and `CoreMessage` type.
*   `examples/tool-management.ts`: Updated to use the new `streamText` API with promises.
*   `examples/limitations.ts`: Updated parameter names (`maxOutputTokens` instead of `maxTokens`).
*   `src/claude-code-language-model.test.ts`: Updated to use the new v5-beta APIs and correct assertions.
*   `src/convert-to-claude-code-messages.test.ts`: Updated to use type-only import for `CoreMessage`.

## Key Migration Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Token Usage Property Names
**Issue**: V4 used `promptTokens`/`completionTokens` while V5 uses `inputTokens`/`outputTokens`/`totalTokens`.
**Solution**: Updated all token usage calculations and test assertions to use the new property names.

### 2. Message Content Format
**Issue**: V5 requires user messages to have content as an array of parts, not a string.
**Solution**: Updated message handling to check for array content and extract text from parts.

### 3. Stream Response Format
**Issue**: V5 streams use different event types and structure.
**Solutions**:
- Added `stream-start` event emission with warnings
- Changed `textDelta` to `delta` in stream parts
- Removed `warnings` from doStream return type (now included in stream-start)

### 4. Example Code Patterns
**Issue**: Examples were using destructuring pattern that doesn't work with v5's promise-based API.
**Solution**: Updated all examples to call streamText first, then await individual properties.

### 5. TypeScript Strict Mode Issues
**Issues**:
- Lexical declarations in switch cases
- Type-only imports required for `CoreMessage`
- Invalid properties in API calls
**Solutions**:
- Added block scope to switch cases
- Changed to type-only imports where needed
- Removed mode parameter from low-level API calls

### 6. Tool Result Format
**Issue**: Tests were using v4 format with `result` property, but v5 uses `output`.
**Solution**: Added handling for test data that was still using v4 format. In production, only v5 format messages will be received.

## Rationale for Changes

The changes were made to align the provider with the new `LanguageModelV2` architecture and the other breaking changes introduced in the Vercel AI SDK v5-beta. This is a complete breaking change - the updated provider ONLY works with AI SDK v5-beta and is NOT compatible with v4.

## Testing and Validation

- All 230 tests are passing
- TypeScript compilation is successful with no errors
- ESLint passes with only minor warnings about `any` types in tests
- Examples have been updated and are syntactically correct
